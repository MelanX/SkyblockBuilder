Inviting users
Everyone in a team can invite other players. For that, you can use `/skyblock invite <player>`. That will send an 
invitation to the given player. Only players with no team can be invited.

## Accepting invitations
Everyone with an invitation can accept them. You can only accept invitations if you're in no team. For that, you use the
command `/skyblock accept <team>`. You can also decline an invitation by using the command `/skyblock decline <team>`.
