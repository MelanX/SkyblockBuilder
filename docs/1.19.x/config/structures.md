# Structures
## Generating Structures
A list with all [structures 🔗](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Generated_structures) that should be generated. A list
with all possible structures can be found in `config/skyblockbuilder/data/structures.txt`. Some structures in the nether
are being generated by default, but you could turn that off. Overworld only has the stronghold as default option.

This is a resource list. Read more about it [here 🔗](https://moddingx.org/libx/org/moddingx/libx/util/data/ResourceList.html#use_resource_lists_in_configs).

## Generating Features
A list with all [features 🔗](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Configured_feature) that should be generated. A list
with all possible features can be found in `config/skyblockbuilder/data/features.txt`. As you can read in the Minecraft 
Wiki article, features need special conditions to be generated properly. This can be done with the surface.

INFO: The two default values are required for the obsidian towers in end. If this is missing, they will be first 
generated when respawning the dragon.
