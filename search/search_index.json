Otherwise, it's the same as in single player . Creating a custom skyblock island Build an island. Use the custom item Structure Saver from the vanilla Tools tab in creative inventory. The output directory for this is <minecraft>/skyblock_exports/<name>.nbt . Alternatively, you can also use the vanilla Structure Block. Keep in mind that this can only save islands up to 48x48x48 blocks and the output is in <minecraft>/saves/<world>/generated/minecraft/structures/<name>.nbt . Copy the generated file from its directory (see previous step) to config/skyblockbuilder/templates/<name>.nbt . Configure the template with a better readable name and spawns in config/skyblockbuilder/templates.json5 . There can be multiple spawns, each one is an array with [x, y, z] relative to the 0, 0, 0 from the template structure. You can also modify existing spawns and export them with /skyblock spawns EXPORT . IMPORTANT: You need to be in a world with world-type Skyblock to use the commands. To view your current spawns, you need to use the /reload command to reload the config. After that, you need to use the /skyblock spawns true command to view all possible spawn points.

The key (here default ) is important for the templates option in the next step. You can have multiple entries, but keep in mind that no key can be used twice! The content of each object is an array.

The spawn positions are formatted this way: [ x, y, z ] Now the templates : { \"templates\" : [ { \"name\" : \"default\" , \"file\" : \"default.nbt\" , \"spawns\" : \"default\" } ] } The name is the name displayed in the Customize screen when selecting the world-type. The file is the name of the file for that template. The spawns is the spawn configuration name from the spawns option. You can have the same file and the same spawns in multiple configurations.

Loot chests on island If you want a loot chest on an island, you need to set the NBT data to the chest with the /data merge block <x y z> {LootTable: modid:path/to/loot_table} command to set it as loot chest.
