It will generate a config called forge-common.toml . Change the only value in this config to skyblockbuilder:custom_skyblock , or use this example and create a file called forge-common.toml in the config directory with this content: [general] defaultWorldType = \"skyblockbuilder:custom_skyblock\" Setting world type on server as default If you want to provide a custom server.properties file, set the level-type to skyblockbuilder:custom_skyblock . Otherwise, it's the same as in single player . Creating a custom skyblock island Build an island. Use the custom item Structure Saver from the vanilla Tools tab in creative inventory. The output directory for this is <minecraft>/skyblock_exports/<name>.nbt . Alternatively, you can also use the vanilla Structure Block. Keep in mind that this can only save islands up to 48x48x48 blocks and the output is in <minecraft>/saves/<world>/generated/minecraft/structures/<name>.nbt . Copy the generated file from its directory (see previous step) to config/skyblockbuilder/templates/<name>.nbt . Set the possible spawns in config/skyblockbuilder/spawns.json . There can be multiple spawns, each one is an array with [x, y, z] relative to the 0, 0, 0 from the template structure. You can also modify existing spawns and export them with /skyblock spawns EXPORT . IMPORTANT: You need to be in a world with world-type Skyblock to use the commands. To view your current spawns, you need to use the /reload command to reload the config. After that, you need to use the /skyblock spawns true command to view all possible spawn points. Repeat step 4 and 5 until everything is correct. Setting multiple templates You can set multiple schematics by putting them into config/skyblockbuilder/templates/ . These schematics can the user use by pressing the Customize button in world options screen or changing the schematic with command /skyblock manage islandShape <template> . IMPORTANT : DO NOT name any of these schematic files template.nbt because it would be overwritten by the default schematic in config/skyblockbuilder/template.nbt . Possible spawns Possible spawns are set in config/skyblockbuilder/spawns.json . For each player, the game will choose a random position and places the player on that position. Good on big islands when adding a lot of players at once at one team. You can also export your current spawn points with command /skyblock spawns EXPORT . For this, you should first modify spawns .

Otherwise, it's the same as in single player . Creating a custom skyblock island Build an island. Use the custom item Structure Saver from the vanilla Tools tab in creative inventory. The output directory for this is <minecraft>/skyblock_exports/<name>.nbt . Alternatively, you can also use the vanilla Structure Block. Keep in mind that this can only save islands up to 48x48x48 blocks and the output is in <minecraft>/saves/<world>/generated/minecraft/structures/<name>.nbt . Copy the generated file from its directory (see previous step) to config/skyblockbuilder/templates/<name>.nbt .

The key (here default ) is important for the templates option in the next step. You can have multiple entries, but keep in mind that no key can be used twice! The content of each object is an array. This array contains the spawn positions. The spawn positions are formatted this way: [ x, y, z ] Now the templates : { \"templates\" : [ { \"name\" : \"default\" , \"desc\" : \"Default template\" , \"file\" : \"default.nbt\" , \"spawns\" : \"default\" , \"direction\" : \"south\" } ] } The name is the name displayed in the Customize screen when selecting the world-type.
